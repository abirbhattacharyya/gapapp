OrderedErrorMessagesFor
=======================

This plugin patches ActiveRecord::Errors and ActionView::Base so that
the output of error_messages_for() can be ordered. In the core, it 
is not ordered, and the display sequence is determined through iteration 
of hash keys.


Example
=======

error_messages_for(:user, :order=>[:name,:password,:phone_number])
error_messages_for(:user, :order=>{:user=>[:name,:password,:phone_number]})
